### Is there a file size limit when I upload media?
Yes, there is a 500MB limit on all uploaded media. If you have a file larger than 500MB, we suggest cutting the video into smaller pieces or compressing the file into a different format.

### Where are my files stored? 
We’ll hang on to them for you. All we ask it that you don’t take advantage of our hospitality. Go over 3 GB and we’re going to start asking for a little something for the effort. But for now, have a good time getting to know Stroome.

### Can I use other people's video?
 Of course you can. It's called collaboration, and that's what we're all about. Let’s say you’re looking for that ‘killer’ shot. That one piece of film that’s really going to set your project apart. Well, just because you don’t have the shot, doesn’t mean some else hasn’t got it. Hundreds or collaborators, thousands of clips, unlimited possibilities. That's the essence of Stroome.
