## What’s in a name? Quite a bit, actually

When we were coming up with the idea for the world’s most collaborative editing site, we wanted a name that would work as both a noun and a verb. Much in the same way people now say, “Google it,” we want people to say, “Stroome me,” when they have some great content they want to share. Of course, we didn’t have the word ‘Stroome’ yet.

But the Dutch did—‘Stromen.’ It means ‘to move freely,’ which is exactly what we want our site to facilitate—the movement of ideas, points of view and content freely between people. We played with the spelling a bit, but the name was perfect.
